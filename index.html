    <p>We started our ETH journey first by buying Ethereum over a year ago once we realized what ETH was VS BTC. We both
        come from a finance background and have some programming experience, but never touched javascript or solidity
        before. When the Hackathon started, we began by taking some intro tutorials on solidity. After a full week of
        diving headfirst and trying to understand how solidity works, we decided we wanted to deploy and build a simple
        UI to interact with our contract. This is where we hit a roadblock. The learning curve for a complete noob like
        us, for web3.js vs solidity, was overwhelming considering our timeline to have our project submitted. We took
        over three web3.js intro tutorials, read numerous web3 how-to's, and read through the web3.js documentations.
        After countless hours/days of failing and trying again, we were able to deploy a working VERY simple dApp. We
        will be furthering our web3.js skills as well as solidity through the rest of 2020' and on.
